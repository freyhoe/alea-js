# Alea

  

Rust port of Johannes Baag√∏e's Alea PRNG.

  

This project contains three functions:
**Alea**: a rust port of Alea, guaranteed to output the exact values as the original 0.9 version of javascript Alea
**Mash**: Alea's string hasher
**AleaFast**: a rust port of Alea optimized for performance, however it may differ from the original on extreme seeds or heavy rng rolls
