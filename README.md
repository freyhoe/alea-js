This project contains three functions:

**Alea**: a rust port of Alea, guaranteed to output the exact values as the original 0.9 version of javascript Alea

**Mash**: Alea's string hasher

**AleaFast**: a rust port of Alea optimized for performance, however it may differ from the original on extreme seeds or heavy rng rolls
